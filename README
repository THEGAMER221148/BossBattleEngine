Hi!

This is an "engine" for those Undertale-style boss battles where you fight in a turn-based manner. It runs on HTML5 and Javascript, so it's perfect for websites. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just search up "undertale boss fight". It's a really popular format!

All you really need to touch is the Main function. Everything else is mostly provided in the engine code; however, feel free to mod the base engine to your needs!

The dialogue system is a bit quirky but ill try my best to explain it. Basically, the function in the last parameter runs after the user presses enter on the current box. This DOES mean that your Main.js will eventually turn into nested hell of lke 500 functions inside each other but just don't think about it too hard and you'll probably be fine.
